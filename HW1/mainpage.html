    <h3>Reasons that the above list is not an numbered list</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>I feel as if there should not be an order to a bunch of options</li>
        <li>Could work if there was some sort of subscription tiers but im too lazy</li>
        <li>Normal ordered lists are lame</li>
        <li>I did not see this requirement until after I had already implemented my list</li>
        <li>Bored</li>
        <li>Since the content doesn't matter I think this should be ok?</li>
    </ol>
